To work:
- Need to load all libraries loaded at NSCL.
- Need to load shared MoNA libraries.
- Need .rootrc file and proper .rootlogon file.

Gates:

- Use TTreeFormula to evaluate gate strings.
- Use Map class to correlate gate names and strings.
- Need to load the shared library containing TTreeFormula:
	gSystem->Load("libTreePlayer");
- Constructor used during the expansion of an alias is different.

CINT input/output:

Histogram Viewer:

- Should put a button to restart the Histogram Viewer, using the command:
	fView = new HistViewer(gClient->GetRoot(),800,300,hmaker)
- How can we choose color or no?
